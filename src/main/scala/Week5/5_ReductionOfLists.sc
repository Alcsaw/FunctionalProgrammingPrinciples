A shorter way to write functions:
Instead of
 `((x, y) => x + y)`,
one can also write shorter:
 `(_ * _)`
Every _ represents a new parameter,
going from left to right.
The parameters are defined at the
next outer pair of parentheses
(or the whole expression if there
are no enclosing parentheses).
So, `sum`and `product` can also be
expressed like this:
 */

/* FoldLeft:
The function reduceLeft is defined
in terms of a more general function,
`foldLeftÂ´.
`foldLeft is like reduceLeft, but it takes
an accumulator, z, as an additional
parameter, which is returned when
foldLeft is called on an empty list.
So, sum and product can also be defined
as follows:
 */
def sum(xs: List[Int]): Int =
  (xs foldLeft 0) (_ + _)

  (xs foldLeft 1) (_ * _)

product(nums)

/*
Applications of foldLeft and reduceLeft unfold
on trees that lean to the left.
They have two dual functions, foldRight and reduceRight,
which produce trees which lean to the right.

While foldLeft would start the first operation
with the zero element operated with the first
element of the list (operated with the next and so on),
foldRight starts with the operation between the first
element of the list with the second, then operated with
the third and so on, until it gets to the last element
and combines it to the zero value.

For operators that are associative or commutative,
foldLeft and foldRight are equivalent, event though
there may be a difference in efficiency. But sometimes
only one of the two operators is appropriate.
